# ThreadPoolSpider
This is an example for building thread pool to scrape.Create a ThreadPool object with work_queue,and put job and arguments into the work_queue,then threads in the pool will automatically get jobs and carry on.The method wait_allcomplete will block until all the jobs in the queue has been done.
